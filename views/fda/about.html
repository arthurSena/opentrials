  The OpenTrialsFDA team is one of the six finalists for the <a
    href="https://www.openscienceprize.org/" rel="external">Open Science
    Prize</a>. This is a collaboration between Dr. Erick Turner, <a
    href="http://www.badscience.net" rel="external">Dr. Ben Goldacre</a> and the
  OpenTrials team at <a href="https://okfn.org" rel="external">Open Knowledge
    International</a>.  The work is closely related to the <a
    href="https://opentrials.net" rel="external">OpenTrials project</a>, which
  aims to locate, match, and share all publicly accessible data and documents,
  on all trials conducted, on all medicines and other treatments, globally.
</p>

<p>
  OpenTrialsFDA works on making clinical trial data from the <a
    href="http://www.fda.gov/" rel="external">FDA</a> (the US Food and Drug
  Administration) more easily accessible and searchable. Until now, this
  information has been hidden in the user-unfriendly Drug Approval Packages that
  the FDA publishes via its dataportal <a
  href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/default.htm" rel="external">Drugs@FDA</a>.
  OpenTrialsFDA extracts the relevant data from the FDA documents, link it to
  other clinical trial data and present it through this new user-friendly web
  interface. Any user can type in a drug name, and see all the places where this
  drug is mentioned in a FDA document. This information is also available
  via the <a href="https://api.opentrials.net/v1/docs/"
  rel="external">OpenTrials API</a>.

  <h2>Unlocking the trove of FDA clinical trials data</h2>

  <p>
    Drug Approval Packages report the methods and results of all
    premarketing clinical trials, both published and unpublished. Interestingly,
    the FDA data is unbiased, compared to reports of clinical trials in academic
    journals. This is because FDA reviewers, unlike most academic journal
    reviewers and editors, have access to the original trial protocol and can
    spot and reject any attempts at post hoc changes to planned outcomes and
    statistical analyses. Therefore, a systematic review (SR) or meta-analysis
    (MA) based on FDA Drug Approval Packages, which includes unpublished and
    â€œunspun" trial results, will often conclude that the drug in question is less
    safe and/or less effective than what one would conclude from a conventional
    SR or MA based solely on the published literature.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unfortunately, despite their high value, these FDA documents are notoriously
    difficult to access, aggregate, and search. The Drugs@FDA website itself is
    not intuitive to navigate, and the reviews are stored as individual PDFs
    which, except for relatively new drugs, cannot be searched. As a consequence,
    they are rarely used by clinicians and researchers. OpenTrialsFDA will
    improve this situation, so that valuable information that is currently hidden
    away can be discovered, presented, and used to properly inform evidence-based
    treatment decisions.

  <h2>The OpenTrialsFDA prototype</h2>

  <p>
    The team has scraped the FDA website and extracted the relevant information
    from the PDFs through a process of OCR (optical character recognition). Through
    this new OpenTrialsFDA interface, users will be able to explore and discover
    the FDA data. In addition, the information will be integrated into the <a
    href="https://opentrials.net/about/" rel="external">OpenTrials database</a>, so
    that the FDA report can be linked to reports from other sources, such as
    ClinicalTrials.gov, EU CTR, HRA, WHO ICTRP, and PubMed.
  </p>
  <p>
    The six finalists of the Open Science Prize will showcase their prototypes at
    the <a href="http://event.capconcorp.com/wp/bd2k-odss/" rel="external">BD2K
      Open Data Science Symposium</a> on 1 December 2016, when public voting
    will begin. The public is asked to help select the most promising, innovative
    and impactful prototype from among the six finalists - of which one will
    receive the grand prize of $230,000.
