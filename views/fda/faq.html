    <dt>What is the Drugs@FDA portal?</dt>
    <dd>
      <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/default.htm" rel="external">Drugs@FDA</a>
      is a searchable catalog of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      approved drug products, both prescription and over the counter, with
      links to documents relating to marketing approval. More information is
      available from their <a
      href="http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/daf/index.cfm?event=faq.page"
      rel="external">FAQ section</a>.
    </dd>

    <dt>What are FDA drug approval packages?</dt>
    <dd>
      FDA Drug Approval Packages consist of FDA employees' reviews of new drug
      applications (NDAs) submitted by pharmaceutical companies seeking
      approval to market their drugs in the US. These NDAs consist primarily of
      clinical study reports (CSRs). Some drugs have more than one approval
      package, because approval is granted not for a drug per se, but for each
      drug-indication combination. 
    </dd>

    <dt>How will OpenTrialsFDA improve access to the FDA data?</dt>
    <dd>
      The team will scrape the FDA website and extract the relevant information
      from the PDFs through a process of OCR (optical character recognition).
      Through the new OpenTrialsFDA interface, users will be able to explore and
      discover the FDA data. In addition, the information has been integrated into
      the OpenTrials database, so that the FDA report can be linked to reports
      from other sources, such as ClinicalTrials.gov, EU CTR, HRA, WHO ICTRP, and
      PubMed.
    </dd>

    <dt>How does the FDA review process differ from the peer review process
    used for manuscripts submitted to journals?</dt>
    <dd>
      The key is the before-versus-after-the-trial aspect. Before the sponsor
      can begin a trial in the US, it must submit the trial protocol to the
      FDA. By means of this "pre-trial" review of the protocol, the FDA learns
      (1) that that trial is to be conducted and (2) the nitty-gritty
      methodological details. That way, a few years later, when the sponsor
      submits its NDA, the reviewer compares the clinical study report (CSR) to
      the original protocol to determine (1) whether any studies have been
      omitted and (2) whether any outcomes have been switched. By contrast, in
      the world of peer-reviewed journal articles, there is no "pre-trial"
      review, allowing both (1) and (2) to take place.
    </dd>

    <dt>Who authors FDA reviews?</dt>
    <dd>
      The FDA review team is multidisciplinary, yielding different types of
      reviews. Medical reviews are usually authored by physicians who summarize
      and evaluates the data on drug efficacy and safety. Statistical reviews
      are carried out by statisticians who test whether they can replicate the
      sponsor's results using the patient-level data submitted electronically.
      There are other review disciplines, e.g. chemistry,
      pharmacology-toxicology, whose reviews pertain primarily to the
      preclinical phase and early clinical (human) phases of drug development.

    <dt>What is the Open Science Prize?</dt>
    <dd>
      The <a href="https://www.openscienceprize.org/" rel="external">Open
      Science Prize</a> is a collaboration between the Wellcome Trust, the US
      National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Howard Hughes Medical
      Institute. Its goal is to unleash the power of open content and data to
      advance biomedical research and its application for health benefit. The
      OpenTrialsFDA team is one of the <a
      href="https://www.openscienceprize.org/res/p/finalists/"
      rel="external">six finalist teams</a> that were selected in May 2016.
      All teams will showcase their prototypes at the <a
      href="http://event.capconcorp.com/wp/bd2k-odss/" rel="external">BD2K Open
      Data Science Symposium</a> on 1 December 2016, when public voting will
      begin. The public is asked to help select the most promising, innovative
      and impactful prototypes from among the six finalists - among which one
      will receive the grand prize of $230,000.

  <h2>Troubleshooting your search</h2>

  In case you're having difficulty with your search, here are some questions
  you can consider.

  <dl>
    <dt>Was the drug approved before or after 1997?</dt>
    <dd>
      The FDA started posting reviews (Drug Approval Packages) in 1997. If the
      drug in question was approved in 1996 or earlier, you probably will not
      find it posted.
    </dd>

    <dt>Are you sure that the use you're interested in is not off-label, ie.
    that the FDA approved it for the indication you're interested in?</dt>
    <dd>
      Oftentimes drugs are used widely for a certain condition (indication) for
      which the FDA has not granted approval (off-label use). If you check the
      product label (e.g. at <a
      href="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/index.cfm"
      rel="external">https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/index.cfm</a>) and
      look within the section on "Indications and Usage", you will see a list
      of the approved indications.
    </dd>

    <dt>Are you looking for indication #1 or one of the subsequent ones?</dt>
    <dd>
      A given drug might be FDA-approved for multiple indications. The FDA is
      careful about posting the Drug Approval Package for the first indication
      (the one that allowed that drug to enter the market), but for subsequent
      indications (#2, #3, etc.), it's more hit-or-miss.  If you are motivated,
      one way to get such reviews is to <a
      href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/foi/FOIRequest/requestinfo.cfm"
      rel="external">file a Freedom of Information request</a>; but be warnedâ€”the
      FDA might take months or longer to fulfill your request. If you do get such
      reviews, we would appreciate you <a
      href="https://explorer.opentrials.net/contribute-data">sharing it with
      us</a> so we can add to OpenTrialsFDA and make it available to others. 
    </dd>

    <dt>Did you use the generic name or brand name?</dt>
    <dd>
      If you use the generic name, you will probably get lots of hits: one
      for when the molecule was first being introduced to the market plus hits
      for subsequent generic versions. The FDA does its review for efficacy and
      safety when the molecule is first introduced to the market. Years later,
      when the patent expires, generic equivalents get approved, but what the FDA
      cares about at this stage is bioequivalence (in terms of blood levels) to
      the original brand name version. Thus generics do not have to demonstrate
      efficacy and safety all over again, which is why these approval packages
      generally contain little or no such data.
    </dd>

    <dt>Is the review an NDA or an ANDA?</dt>
    <dd>
      Please see the question and answer immediately above. NDAs (new drug
      applications) correspond to brand name versions, while ANDAs (abbreviated
      new drug applications) correspond to generic equivalents. They are
      abbreviated because less is required of the sponsor (see above). Assuming
      you are interested in drug efficacy and/or safety (and not
      bioequivalence), you will want to focus on NDAs and ignore ANDAs.
    </dd>

    <dt>Is this the original or a subsequent formulation of a drug?</dt>
    <dd>
      This is similar to the issue brand name versions vs. generic versions
      (see above). The burden of proof regarding efficacy and safety is highest
      when a molecule is first entering the market. A given drug will often
      enter the market as an immediate release (IR) formulation, before which
      the FDA will do its most comprehensive review of drug efficacy and
      safety. Some years later, the sponsor may seek approval for a
      sustained-release (SR) formulation, but by that time, millions of
      patients have already been exposed to the IR formulation. Because it is
      relatively unlikely that the efficacy and/or safety profile will differ a
      great deal between the IR and the SR, the SR may have to do fewer
      clinical trials compared to its IR version.
